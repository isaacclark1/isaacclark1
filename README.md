## Hi there, I'm Isaac Clark ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying software development since the COVID lockdowns of 2020 and 2021. After learning to code through sites such as [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and books from [Jon Duckett](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/135171.Jon_Duckett), I decided to pursue a degree in [Computing and IT](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-computing-it-software-q62-soft) with the Open University, specialising in software. Having recently finished my degree, I'm on the lookout for for a role in software development, with a particular desire to become a full stack or back-end web developer.
